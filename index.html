        <td>Golf is a web application framework. It combines a clientside
            mvc with a sophisticated and easy-to-use component system.
            features include full support for deep-linking, automatic
            google ajax crawling, commonjs-style libraries, encapsulated
            html, css, and js per component, automatic static or war file
            deployment.

        <td valign="top"><a href="http://github.com/micha/resty">resty</a>
        </td>
        <td>A small rest client for bash or zsh. The goal is to reduce
            the amount of boilerplate involved with command-line rest
            requests. It is implemented as functions in the shell and
            works in the usual unix tools fashion. You can pipe data
            into, out of, and through resty in pipelines with sed, awk,
            perl, etc.

        </td>
        <td>Jsawk is to json as awk is to text. This script takes json
            data as input and iterates through, filtering each object
            through the specified js code. The goal is to provide a means
            of robustly manipulating json data from the command line in
            scripts and pipelines. Features include support for js library
            loading, output to stdout, stderr, and files, and more.

        </td>
        <td>Imap-js is a js imap client. The idea was to use a pass-through
            proxy on the server to connect directly from the browser to the
            imap server, thereby rendering the serverside webmail application
            code unnecessary. This would simplify administration of the
            webmail system because there would be no serverside scripting or
            database. Security would be improved by the removal of the most
            common sources of exploitable bugs. Judicious use of html5
            facilities for clientside storage and databases would greatly
            improve usability and performance vs. regular serverside webmail.
