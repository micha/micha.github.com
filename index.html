            google ajax crawling, commonjs-style libraries, encapsulated
            html, css, and js per component, automatic static or war file

        </td>
        <td>A small rest client for bash or zsh. The goal is to reduce
            the amount of boilerplate involved with command-line rest
            requests. It is implemented as functions in the shell and
            works in the usual unix tools fashion. You can pipe data
            into, out of, and through resty in pipelines with sed, awk,
            perl, etc.

        <td>Jsawk is to json as awk is to text. This script takes json
            data as input and iterates through, filtering each object
            through the specified js code. The goal is to provide a means
            of robustly manipulating json data from the command line in
            scripts and pipelines. Features include support for js library
            loading, output to stdout, stderr, and files, and more.
