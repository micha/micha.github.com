        <td><p>Golf is a web application framework. It combines a clientside
          mvc with a sophisticated and easy-to-use component system.
          Features include full support for deep-linking, automatic
          google ajax crawling, commonjs-style libraries, encapsulated
          html, css, and js per component, automatic static or war file
          deployment.</p>

        <td valign="top"><p><a href="http://github.com/micha/resty">resty</a></p>
        </td>
        <td><p>A small rest client for bash or zsh. The goal is to reduce
          the amount of boilerplate involved with command-line rest
          requests. It is implemented as functions in the shell and
          works in the usual unix tools fashion. You can pipe data
          into, out of, and through resty in pipelines with sed, awk,
          perl, etc.</p>

        </td>
        <td><p>Jsawk is to json as awk is to text. This script takes json
          data as input and iterates through, filtering each object
          through the specified js code. The goal is to provide a means
          of robustly manipulating json data from the command line in
          scripts and pipelines. Features include support for js library
          loading, output to stdout, stderr, files, and more.</p>

        </td>
        <td><p>Imap-js is a js imap client. The idea was to use a pass-through
          proxy on the server to connect directly from the browser to the
          imap server, thereby rendering the serverside webmail application
          code unnecessary. This would simplify administration of the
          webmail system because there would be no serverside scripting or
          database. Security would be improved by the removal of the most
          common sources of exploitable bugs. Judicious use of html5
          facilities for clientside storage and databases would greatly
          improve usability and performance vs. regular serverside webmail.</p>

        <td><p>An edit-in-place jquery plugin that provides a simple, easy to
          use interface for editing html web pages. Originally written for
          a static, cloudfront-hosted McWebsite business.</p>

        </td>
        <td><p> This is the companion to jquery-eip, above. This plugin manages
          uploading of the page to S3 and cloudfront. The idea behind these
          plugins is to allow interactive updates to statically hosted websites
          on amazon's aws infrastructure, using js to modify the page in-place,
          and then updating it on aws via ajax post request. Very affordable
          and scalable website hosting is the result.</p>

          sortable. Flexible, configurable, and simple to use, it's also
          pretty fast and responsive.</p>
